# Google Summer of Code

## Introduction

Google Summer of Code[website] (GSoC) is a program that allows students to contribute to development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations. CERN-SFT participates in GSoC since 2011. This year the program has been expanded to involve the wider high-energy physics community via the HEP Software Foundation.  

Students interested in participating in the GSoC can find project proposals down here.

Instructions for participating projects or mentors can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/mentors.html).


## Projects

{:.table .table-hover  .table-striped}
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/rootlogo.png" width="100"> | A modular scientific software framework. It provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing, statistical analysis, visualisation and storage. It is mainly written in C++ but integrated with other languages such as Python and R. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_root.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/tmva_logo.gif" width="100"> | TMVA is a ROOT-integrated toolkit for multivariate classification and regression analysis. TMVA performs the training, testing and performance evaluation of a large variety of multivariate methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_tmva.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/geanttiny.gif" width="100"> | Geant (for GEometry ANd Tracking) is a platform for "the simulation of the passage of particles through matter," using Monte Carlo methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_geant4.html)|

## Participating Organizations

{:.table .table-hover  .table-striped}
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/CERN-logo.jpg" width="100"> | At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. They use the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments to study the basic constituents of matter â€“ the fundamental particles. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/cern.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/FNAL-Logo-NAL-Blue.jpg" width="100"> | Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), located just outside Batavia, Illinois, near Chicago, is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory specializing in high-energy particle physics. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/fnal.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/SLAC_Logo.png" width="100"> | SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, originally named Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, is a United States Department of Energy National Laboratory operated by Stanford University under the programmatic direction of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and located in Menlo Park, California.[List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/slac.html) |
