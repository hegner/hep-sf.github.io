# Google Summer of Code 2017

## Introduction

[Google Summer of Code 2017] (https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) is a program that allows students to contribute to development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations. CERN-SFT participates in GSoC since 2011. This year the program has been expanded to involve the wider high-energy physics community via the HEP Software Foundation.  

Students interested in participating in the GSoC can find project proposals [here](#Projects).

HSF GSoC Administrators: Sergei Gleyzer <a href="mailto:sergei@cern.ch">sergei@cern.ch</a> and Enric Tejedor Saavedra <a href="mailto:etejedor@cern.ch">etejedor@cern.ch</a>

Instructions for participating projects and mentors can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/mentors.html)

{:.table .table-hover  .table-striped}
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/rootlogo.png" width="100"> | A modular scientific software framework. It provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing, statistical analysis, visualisation and storage. It is mainly written in C++ but integrated with other languages such as Python and R. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_root.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/tmva_logo.gif" width="100"> | TMVA is a ROOT-integrated toolkit for multivariate classification and regression analysis. TMVA performs the training, testing and performance evaluation of a large variety of multivariate methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_tmva.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/geanttiny.gif" width="100"> | Geant (for GEometry ANd Tracking) is a platform for "the simulation of the passage of particles through matter," using Monte Carlo methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_geant4.html)|

## Participating Organizations
